The code for analysis modules goes in the $src$ folder. Analysis modules will
  be a subclass of the class AnalysisModule found in [[../src/AnalysisModule.hpp]]
  
They implement two methods:
- $bool is_running()$. This method will tell if the instance of the analysis
  module is running or not, so that requests for data can be delayed until it
  stops running and avoid filling a queue and not being able to pop from that
  queue.
- $void run()$. This method will be the one that is being called when we want
  the instance to do decoding, processing and exporting of the data. Takes as
  input the data that it will receive, so it can be overloaded to do different
  things depending on what data it is receiving
