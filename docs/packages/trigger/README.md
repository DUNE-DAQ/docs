# About trigger

The `trigger` package contains the modules that make up the DUNE FD DAQ trigger system. Implementations of the physics algorithms that produce data selection objects (trigger activity and trigger candidates) live in the `triggeralgs` package.

For instructions on writing your own physics algorithm, see [How to write a trigger algorithm](trigger-alg-howto.md).
