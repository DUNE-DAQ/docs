# Onboarding Page for New DUNE DAQ Collaborators


**Who this page is for:** If you're brand new to the DUNE DAQ consortium, you're in the right place!

## Accounts, etc. 

You'll need a few accounts to work with the DUNE DAQ consortium. These include:


* Access to the np04 computing cluster based in CERN's EHN1 building. This is where the heart of DUNE DAQ development, running and testing takes place. You need to access the nodes in this cluster from...

* ...[CERN's lxplus cluster](https://abpcomputing.web.cern.ch/computing_resources/lxplus/), where you'll first need to get an account

* ...and to do that, you'll need to start with a [CERN user account](https://account.cern.ch/account/)


* A user account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is where we store DUNE DAQ package code in [git version controlled](https://git-scm.com/) repositories. _Make sure you can be easily identified by your username, otherwise change it or open a new GitHub account._


* Access to [Slack](https://slack.com)'s [dunescience.slack.com](https://dunescience.slack.com) workspace. Much of the day-to-day communication between developers takes place here. Within the workspace, start by joining these channels:

    * **dunedaq-integration**: general activity in DUNE DAQ development

    * **daq-sw-librarians**: the channel where you request membership in [the DUNE-DAQ organization on GitHub](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ) as well as membership on a particular development team. It helps speed things up if you have your local institution's DUNE DAQ group leader vouch for you on this channel.  


* A [Zoom account](https://zoom.us/) so you can join online meetings. Again, try to have a name that makes you easy to identify. 

## Websites


* Documentation for end users of DUNE DAQ software can be found in the [official DUNE DAQ documentation page](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


* Documentation for developers of a particular DUNE DAQ package should be put in the GitHub Wiki for that package's repo (see an example [here](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/dpdklibs/wiki)). But note...


* ...the [daqconf Wiki](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/daqconf/wiki) is special in that it not only provides specific info for daqconf developers but general info for all DUNE DAQ developers


* The [Indico website for DUNE DAQ meetings](https://indico.fnal.gov/category/700/). Note that you'll generally be going to the page which you access by clicking "General Meetings", though certain types of domain-specific meetings (technical, software release coordination, etc.) will be contained in the "Technical Meetings" page. 

## Email subscriptions

Using [Fermilab's listserv service](https://listserv.fnal.gov/), subscribe to `dune-fd-daq-cnsrt@listserv.fnal.gov`. This is where important messages about meetings, etc. are sent to the consortium. 

## Next steps

Read the introduction to DUNE DAQ software at the top of the [official documentation](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
