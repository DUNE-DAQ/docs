# ComponentRequest v0 (Deprecated)

This document describes the format of the ComponentRequest struct, version 0 (unversioned).

# Description of ComponentRequest

ComponentRequest version 0 (unversioned) consists of 6 32-bit words:



0. [GeoID version 0 (unversioned)](GeoIDV0.md) Component Type (upper 16 bits), Region ID (lower 16 bits)


1. [GeoID version 0 (unversioned)](GeoIDV0.md) Element ID


2. Window Begin (upper 32 bits)


3. Window Begin (lower 32 bits)


4. Window End (upper 32 bits)


5. Window End (lower 32 bits)

# C++ Code for ComponentRequest

```CPP
struct ComponentRequest
{
  GeoID component;
  timestamp_t window_begin{ TypeDefaults::s_invalid_timestamp };
  timestamp_t window_end{ TypeDefaults::s_invalid_timestamp };
};
```

# Notes

ComponentRequest does not currently have a version field. If its format changes, it would have to either be rolled into a version update of the products that use it, or have a version number added.
