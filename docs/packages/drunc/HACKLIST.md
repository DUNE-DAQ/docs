# Hacklist / TODO

Below is a hack list, places where I'm not particularly happy with the current implementation

## Internal hacks (sloppy coding from me)
 - [ ] Kafka's topic for status broadcasting


## External (things that'd get better with more )
 - [ ] PyERS dependency: We need to rely on ERS
