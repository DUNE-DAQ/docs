# DUNE DAQ Buildtools 

The toolset to simplify the development of DUNE DAQ packages

## System requirements

To get set up, you'll need access to the ups product area `/cvmfs/dunedaq.opensciencegrid.org/products`, as is the case, e.g., on the lxplus machines at CERN. 

## Setup of `daq-buildtools`

`daq-buildtools` is a package which provides environment and building utilities for the DAQ Suite. It is available via cvmfs or cloning the repository to local disk.

To use `daq-buildtools` from cvmfs, simply do:

```bash
source /cvmfs/dunedaq.opensciencegrid.org/setup_dunedaq.sh
setup_dbt dunedaq-v2.5.0 # "dunedaq-v2.5.0" can be replaced with any other tags of daq-buildtools
```

To use `daq-buildtools` by cloning its repository, do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/daq-buildtools.git -b dunedaq-v2.5.0
```
Each cloned daq-buildtools can serve as many work areas as the developer wishes. This step doesn't have to be run more than once per daq-buildtools version. 
If using daq-buildtools via cloning the repo, its setup script has to be sourced to make the various daq-buildtools commands available. Run:
```bash
source daq-buildtools/env.sh
```

In either case of using `setup_dbt dunedaq-v2.5.0` with daq-buildtools from cvmfs or sourcing the setup script from the local clone, you'll see something like:
```
Added /your/path/to/daq-buildtools/bin to PATH
Added /your/path/to/daq-buildtools/scripts to PATH
DBT setuptools loaded
```
The commands include `dbt-create.sh`, `dbt-build.sh`, and `dbt-workarea-env`; these are all described in the following sections.

Each time that you want to work with a DUNE DAQ work area in a fresh Linux shell, you'll need to set up daq-buildtools using either of the methods above, or you can cd into your work area and source the link file named `dbt-env.sh`. Work areas are described next. 

## Creating a work area

Once you've set up `daq-buildtools` via `setup_dbt` or via sourcing `daq-buildtools/env.sh`, you're now ready to create a work area. Find a directory in which you want your work area to be a subdirectory, and cd into it. Then think of a good name for the area (give it any name, but we'll refer to it as "MyTopDir" on this wiki). Then you can run:
```sh
dbt-create.sh <release> <your work area subdirectory> # dunedaq-v2.5.0 is the most recent frozen release as of May-14-2020
```
which will set up an area to place the repos you wish to build. Remember to cd into the subdirectory you just created after `dbt-create.sh` finishes running. 

Since the `dunedaq-v2.5.0` release, `dbt-create.sh` has supported not only frozen releases but the use of nightly built releases as well. Add `-n` to the `dbt-create.sh` command above to use nightly releases, e.g. ` dbt-create.sh -n N21-05-13 <your work area subdirectory>`. Pass `-l` to `dbt-create.sh` in order to list all available frozen releases, and `-l -n` to list all available nightly releases.

The structure of your work area will look like the following:
```txt
MyTopDir
â”œâ”€â”€ build
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt-pyvenv
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt-settings
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt-env.sh -> /path/to/daq-buildtools/env.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ log
â””â”€â”€ sourcecode
    â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
    â””â”€â”€ dbt-build-order.cmake
```

For the purposes of instruction, let's build the `listrev` package. Downloading it is simple:
```
cd sourcecode
git clone https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/listrev.git -b dunedaq-v2.5.0 
cd ..
```
Note the assumption above is that you aren't developing listrev; if you were, then you'd want to replace `-b dunedaq-v2.5.0` with `-b <branch you want to work on>`.

## Adding extra UPS products and product pools

Sometimes it is necessary to tweak the baseline list of UPS products or even UPS product pools to add extra dependencies; skip ahead to the next section if you don't need to worry about this. Adding extra dependencies can be easily done by editing the `dbt-settings` file copied over from daq-buildtools by `dbt-create.sh` and adding the new entries to `dune_products_dirs`  and `dune_daqpackages` as needed. See `/example/of/additional/user/declared/product/pool` and `package_declared_by_user v1_2_3 e19:prof` in the example of an edited `dbt-settings` file, below:

```bash
dune_products_dirs=(
    "/cvmfs/dunedaq.opensciencegrid.org/releases/dunedaq-v2.5.0/externals"
    "/cvmfs/dunedaq.opensciencegrid.org/releases/dunedaq-v2.5.0/packages"
    "/example/of/additional/user/declared/product/pool"

    "package_declared_by_user v1_2_3 e19:prof"
    )
```
As the names suggest, `dune_products_dirs` contains the list of UPS product pools and `dune_daqpackages` contains a list of UPS products sourced when you first run `dbt-workarea-env` (described below). If you've already run `dbt-workarea-env` before editing the `dbt-settings` file, you'll need to run `dbt-workarea-env --refresh` to force a reload.

## Compiling
We're about to build and install the `listrev` package. (&#x1F534; Note: if you are working with other packages, have a look at the [Working with more repos](#working-with-more-repos) subsection before running the following build command.) By default, the scripts will create a subdirectory of MyTopDir called `./install ` and install any packages you build off your repos there. If you wish to install them in another location, you'll want to set the environment variable `DBT_INSTALL_DIR` to the desired installation path after the `dbt-workarea-env` command described below, but before the `dbt-build.sh` command. 

Now, do the following:
```sh
dbt-workarea-env  # If you haven't already run this
dbt-build.sh --install
```
...and this will build `listrev` in the local `./build` subdirectory and then install it as a package either in the local `./install` subdirectory or in whatever you pointed `DBT_INSTALL_DIR` to. 

&#x1F534; Hint ðŸ’¡ `dbt-workarea-env` now has a new option `-s/--subset <externals, daqpackages, systems, devtools>` which allows user to set up a subset of UPS products listed in `dbt-settings`.

### Working with more repos

To work with more repos, add them to the `./sourcecode` subdirectory as we did with listrev. Be aware, though: if you're developing a new repo which itself depends on another new repo, daq-buildtools may not already know about this dependency. "New" in this context means "not found in /cvmfs/dunedaq.opensciencegrid.org/releases/dunedaq-v2.5.0/dbt-build-order.cmake". If this is the case, you have one of two options:


* (Recommended) Add the names of your new packages to the `build_order` list found in `./sourcecode/dbt-build-order.cmake`, placing them in the list in the relative order in which you want them to be built. 

* First clone, build and install your new base repo, and THEN clone, build and install your other new repo which depends on your new base repo. 

`dbt-build.sh` will by default skip CMake's config+generate stages and go straight to the build stage _unless_ either the `CMakeCache.txt` file isn't found in `./build` or you've just added a new repo to `./sourcecode`. If you want to remove all the contents of `./build` and run config+generate+build, all you need to do is add the `--clean` option, i.e.
```
dbt-build.sh --clean --install
```
And if, after the build, you want to run the unit tests, just add the `--unittest` option. Note that it can be used with or without `--clean`, so, e.g.:
```
dbt-build.sh --clean --install --unittest  # Blow away the contents of ./build, run config+generate+build, and then run the unit tests
```
..where in the above case, you blow away the contents of `./build`,  run config+generate+build, install the result in `./install` and then run the unit tests. Be aware that for many packages, unit tests will only (fully) work if you've also rerun `dbt-workarea-env` with the argument `--refresh` added. 

To check for deviations from the coding rules described in the [DUNE C++ Style Guide](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/styleguide/), run with the `--lint` option:
```
dbt-build.sh --lint
```
...though be aware that some guideline violations (e.g., having a function which tries to do unrelated things) can't be picked up by the automated linter. 

Note that unlike the other options to `dbt-build.sh`, `--lint` and `--unittest` are both capable of taking an optional argument, which is the name of a specific repo in your work area which you'd like to either lint or run unit tests for. This can be useful if you're focusing on developing one of several repos in your work area. E.g., `dbt-build.sh --lint <repo you're working on>`.

If you want to see verbose output from the compiler, all you need to do is add the `--verbose` option:
```
dbt-build.sh --verbose 
```

If you want to change cmake message log level, you can use the `--cmake-msg-lvl` option:
```
dbt-build.sh --cmake-msg-lvl <ERROR|WARNING|NOTICE|STATUS|VERBOSE|DEBUG|TRACE>
```

You can see all the options listed if you run the script with the `--help` command, i.e.
```
dbt-build.sh --help
```
Finally, note that both the output of your builds and your unit tests are logged to files in the `./log` subdirectory. These files will have ASCII color codes which make them difficult to read with some tools; `less -R <logfilename>`, however, will display the colors and not the codes themselves. 

</details>

## Running

In order to access the applications, libraries and plugins built in your `./build` area during the above procedure, the system needs to be instructed on where to look for them. All you need to do is the following:
```
dbt-workarea-env
```

Note that if you add a new repo to your work area, after building your new code - and hence putting its output in `./build` - you'll need to rerun `dbt-workarea-env`.

Once the runtime environment is set, just run the application you need. listrev, however, has no applications; it's just a set of DAQ module plugins which get added to CET_PLUGIN_PATH.  

We're now going to go through a demo in which we'll use a DAQ module from listrev called RandomDataListGenerator to generate vectors of random numbers and then reverse them with listrev's ListReverser module.  

One of the packages that's part of the standard DUNE DAQ package suite which gets set up when you run `dbt-setup-build-environment` is cmdlib. This package comes with a basic implementation that is capable of sending available command objects from a pre-loaded file, by typing their command IDs to standard input. This command facility is useful for local, test oriented use-cases. In the same runtime area, launch the application like this:
```
daq_application -n <some name for the application instance> -c stdin://sourcecode/listrev/test/list-reversal-app.json
```
and (keeping in mind that you'll want to scroll the contents below horizontally to see the full output) you'll see something like
```
2021-Mar-02 13:09:35,342 LOG [stdinCommandFacility::stdinCommandFacility(...) at /scratch/workdir0/sourcecode/cmdlib/plugins/stdinCommandFacility.cpp:55] Loading commands from file: sourcecode/listrev/test/list-reversal-app.json
2021-Mar-02 13:09:35,342 LOG [stdinCommandFacility::run(...) at /scratch/workdir0/sourcecode/cmdlib/plugins/stdinCommandFacility.cpp:83] Available commands: | init | conf | start | stop
```
What you want to do first is type `init`. Next, type `conf` to execute the configuration, and then `start` to begin the actual process of moving vectors between the two modules. You should see output like the following:
```log
2021-Mar-02 13:12:40,291 DEBUG_63 [dunedaq::listrev::RandomDataListGenerator::do_work(...) at /scratch/workdir0/sourcecode/listrev/plugins/RandomDataListGenerator.cpp:163] Generated list #3 with contents {363, 28, 691, 60, 764} and size 5.  DAQModule: rdlg
2021-Mar-02 13:12:40,291 DEBUG_63 [dunedaq::listrev::ListReverser::do_work(...) at /scratch/workdir0/sourcecode/listrev/plugins/ListReverser.cpp:134] Reversed list #3, new contents {764, 60, 691, 28, 363} and size 5.  DAQModule: lr
2021-Mar-02 13:12:40,291 DEBUG_63 [dunedaq::listrev::ReversedListValidator::do_work(...) at /scratch/workdir0/sourcecode/listrev/plugins/ReversedListValidator.cpp:159] Validating list #3, original contents {363, 28, 691, 60, 764} and reversed contents {764, 60, 691, 28, 363}.  DAQModule: rlv
```
To stop this, type the `stop` command. Ctrl-c will exit you out. 

For a more realistic use-case where you can send commands to the application from other services and applications, the [restcmd](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/restcmd/) package provides a command handling implementation through HTTP. To use this plugin, we call `daq_application` in the following manner:
```sh
daq_application -n <some name for the application instance> --commandFacility rest://localhost:12345
```
To control it, let's open up a second terminal, set up the daq-buildtools' `dbt-setup-env.sh` script as you did in the first terminal, and start sending daq_application commands:
```sh
cd MyTopDir
dbt-workarea-env
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DUNE-DAQ/restcmd/v1.1.0/scripts/send-restcmd.py
python ./send-restcmd.py --interactive --file ./sourcecode/listrev/test/list-reversal-app.json
```
You'll now see
```txt
Target url: http://localhost:12345/command
This is a list of commands.
Interactive mode. Type the ID of the next command to send, or type 'end' to finish.

Available commands: [u'init', u'conf', u'start', u'stop']
Press enter a command to send next: 
```
And you can again type `init`, etc. However, unlike previously, now you'll want to look in the other terminal running daq_application to see it responding to the commands. As before, Ctrl-c will exit you out of these applications. 

## Next Step
