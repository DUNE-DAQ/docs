# Compiling and running under v1.0.0
_*n.b.* Under v1.0.0 the build system was considerably different than under later releases (including v1.1.0). Keep in mind that the appfwk package's code is essentially the same between v1.0.0 and v1.1.0, and it's therefore recommended you go with the v1.1.0 instructions. However, if you _do_ wish to work with the original v1.0.0 release, follow [Step-by-step instructions for creating your own DAQModule package under v1](Step-by-step-instructions-for-creating-your-own-DAQModule-package-under-v1.md)_
