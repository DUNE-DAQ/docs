This repository has tools for generating DAQ system configurations. At the moment, these tools consist of a single Python script that generates DAQ system configurations with different characteristics based on command-line parameters that are given to the script.  This script is daqconf/python/daqconf/scripts/daq_multiru_gen.py.

The focus of this documentation is on providing instructions for using the tools and running sample DAQ systems.
