# daqconf

This repository contains tools for generating DAQ system configurations, the [`daqconf_multiru_gen` script](../scripts/daqconf_multiru_gen) ("DAQ configuration, multiple readout unit generator") and [`daqconf_global_gen` script](../scripts/daqconf_global_gen) ("DAQ configuration, global timing generator"). They generate DAQ system configurations with different characteristics based on command-line parameters that are given to them. 

The focus of this documentation is on providing instructions for using the tools and running sample DAQ systems. If you're starting out, take a look at:

[Instructions for casual or first-time users](InstructionsForCasualUsers.md)

and for a slightly more in-depth look into how to generate configurations for a DAQ system, take a look at:

[Configuration options for casual or first-time users](ConfigurationsForCasualUsers.md)

Finally, here's nice visual representation of the type of DAQ system which can be configured:
